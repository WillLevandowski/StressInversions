%%% 2017 written communication after Cooley, 2014 MS Thesis).
%%% The file StressData is [Longitude Latitude Strike Dip Rake]. The 
%%% strike, dip, and rake can be either of the nodal planes.

%% Set a few parameters related to the inversions and iterations
N_noise_realizations = 100; %%% how many inversions to run (for uncertainties)
mean_deviation =15; %%% in each inversion, there is noise added to the mechanisms
friction_mean=0.65; %%% friction matters for stability factor, which is used to select focal plane
friction_spread=0.7; %%% friction is sampled from a uniform distribution about the stated mean
        
N_realizations = 6; %%% the inversion generates a stacked estimate of the stress tensor with randomly selected focal planes
N_iterations = 6; %%% the inversion then iterates for focal plane selection

%% Inversions can be weighted by distance from a point.
